Before running a plan, please ensure you have selected at least one step.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information about these plans and the metadata they contain, please see <a href='https://help.rioeducation.com/en_US/deployment/rio-education-upgrade-plans'>this article</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>WARNING:</b> If you are installing into an existing Salesforce org - STOP and contact us for assistance to avoid overwriting any existing metadata. It is important to compare the metadata before applying because it would overwrite any existing configuration.\r\n\r\n<b>NOTE:</b> If you are using the out-of-the-box Transfer Credit functionality and you are upgrading directly to v3.11 or higher from a version prior to v3.9, you must first upgrade to v3.9. This is because some of the upgrade tasks for v3.9 depend on fields that are deleted in later versions. If you upgrade to the later package directly, then you will not be able to run these tasks.",
